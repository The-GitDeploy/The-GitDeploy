## <a name='Settinguptherepository'></a>Setting up the repository

### <a name='Createtherepository'></a>Create the repository

Log in to GitHub and navigate to the following repository: [The-GitDeploy/core-config](https://github.com/The-GitDeploy/core-config)

This repository is a template, so you can use it to create your own repository, using this button:

![The "Use this template" button is on the top right of the code section](/img/use_as_template.png "Click 'Use this template' button")

You'll be asked to provide a name for your repository; you can name it however you want. It shouldn't matter whether the repository is private or not, to provide another layer of security you probably want to **make it private** though.

In the file `/compose/management/docker-compose.yml` of your repo, find the line that says `- WATCHED_REPO=` and paste your repository identifier in the format `<user>/<repository>` (e.g. F1nnM/server-management) right after the `=`.    


### <a name='Setupawebhook'></a>Set up a webhook
Navigate to the repos' settings and add a new webhook.

![Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook](/img/webhook.png "Add a new webhook")

Set the Payload URL to `https://<your server>:5555/webhook`.

(if required, this is a good time to open port 5555)

Keep the content type as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and the trigger event as `Just the push event`.

For now, you need to **disable SSL verification**, as the admin interface is 'only' encrypted using a self-signed certificate.

### <a name='Forprivaterepos:GenerateaPAT'></a>(For private repos:) Generate a PAT

For the server to be able to clone a private repo, it needs a Personal Auth Token of your account.

You can generate one in [Githubs developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo). Set a name, set it to not expire, and keep the repo scope.

![](/img/pat.png "Generate PAT")

**Once generated, copy the token.** You need to provide it to the container which is responsible for keeping all the containers updated.  

In the file `/compose/management/docker-compose.yml` of your private repo, find the line that says `- PAT=` and paste your PAT right after the `=`.  
You will still need the PAT at a later stage, so keep it nearby.

## <a name='InstallingGitDeploy'></a>Installing GitDeploy

### <a name='InstallDocker'></a>Install Docker

[Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and follow the installation instructions.

### <a name='LaunchGitDeploy'></a>Launch GitDeploy

Execute the following command:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-GitDeploy/core-config/main/setup.sh)
```

You will be asked to enter your PAT, leave it empty if your repository is public.

After a couple of seconds the basic config should be up and automatically update whenever you push a new config to your repo. You can check if github is able to successfully send the webhook request to your server under your repos' `Recent Deliveries`.

![Settings > Webhooks > <your webhook> > Recent Deliveries](/img/webhook_deliveries.png "Check webhook delivery success")

The monitoring panel is available under `https://username:password@<your server>:5555`. As its certificate is self-signed, you will probably have to explicitly add it to your browsers trusted certificates. The default username is `admin` with the password `admin`.

## <a name='Additionalsteps'></a>Additional steps

### <a name='Changingtheadminpassword'></a>Changing the admin password

The usernames/passwords for the monitoring panel are defined in the file `/compose/management/build_nginx/.htpasswd` in the following format:
```
# comment
username:password
username:password:comment
```
Usernames are supplied in plaintext and passwords can be generated with the following command:
```
openssl passwd -5
```

## <a name='Addingapplications'></a>Adding applications

### <a name='Specifyappindocker-compose.yml'></a>Specify app in `docker-compose.yml`

All containers are specified in a file `/compose/<project name>/docker-compose.yml`, so to add a new app you need to create a new folder and the `docker-compose.yml`-file in there.

You can either look up the syntax of the file [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/) or look at the templates in [this repositoy](https://github.com/The-GitDeploy/templates).

A very basic file might look like this:
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  <service name>:
    image: <docker image>
    restart: always
```

While this file is enough to launch the image, you probably want to do more:

### <a name='Connectinganapptoasubdomain'></a>Connecting an app to a subdomain

To expose a container to the internet to steps are necessary.

#### <a name='ConnectingtotheGitDeploynetwork'></a>Connecting to the GitDeploy network

The setup command automatically created a network, that containers on your server can use to communicate with each other. To connect to it, you need to modify your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  <service name>:
    image: <docker image>
    ports:
      -"<port of the container to connect to>"
    restart: always

networks:
  default:
    external: true
    name: gitdeploy
```

This itself does not expose the container to the internet yet, it only allows other containers to connect to it.

#### <a name='Setingupthenginx-routing'></a>Seting up the nginx-routing

The folder `/compose/nginx` contains a nginx instance that will control all routings. The file `/compose/nginx/build/servers.conf` is a regular nginx configuration file.

To now add a route to connect to your container you need to add the following in that file:
```conf
server {
  listen 443 ssl;

  # if this block is included, a certificate will be issued from Let's Encrypt
  # if you comment it out, a default self-signed certificate will be used
  ssl_certificate_by_lua_block {
    auto_ssl:ssl_certificate()
  }

  # specify the (sub)domain here.
  server_name <domain>;

  # tells nginx to proxy all requests to the given container
  # replace hostname with the name of the service (specified in the docker-compose file)
  # replace port with the port to connect to
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://hostname:port/;
    proxy_read_timeout 1800;
  }
}

```

Now your container can be accessed from anywhere.

### <a name='Accessingotherfilesintherepository'></a>Accessing other files in the repository

**Do NOT link to files using relative paths.**
Instead use the docker volume `gitdeploy` like this:
```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  <service name>:
    image: <docker image>
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - gitdeploy:/gitdeploy:ro

volumes:
  gitdeploy:
    external: true
```

All files of the repository can be accessed from within the container under the path `/gitdeploy`

## <a name='Troubleshooting'></a>Troubleshooting

If you ever pushed a faulty configuration to the degree that the server won't update itself, you can always just connect over SSH and execute the following commands:

Stop all running containers:
```
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

Re-run the init script:
```
bash <(curl -s https://github.com/The-GitDeploy/core-config/blob/main/setup.sh)
```
You can ignore errors like `'Can't create network, because it already exists!'`.
